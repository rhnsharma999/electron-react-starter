# electron development setup

This repo is intended to be a basic setup for electron development. It uses the mono-repo layout and splits the background and the popup scripts separately.

## Building and Running

Ensure you have yarn installed.

| Command                | Description                                                                                        |

| electron-build      | Contains all the build logic. All the dev dependencies are added here and all the other packages depend on this build package. This improves reusability.                                              |
| electron-popup      | Contains code for electron's popup. This uses react and generates a index.html along with a javascript bundle. This is setup from scratch and uses typecscript, webpack for bundling and some loaders. |
